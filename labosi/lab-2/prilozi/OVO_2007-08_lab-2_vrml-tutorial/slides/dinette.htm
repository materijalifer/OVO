#  A Dinette
#  dinette.wrl
#        by David R. Nadeau
#
#  This example illustrates the use of the Inline node.
#
#  Two separate world components are inlined:  a table, and a chair.  The
#  chair is then instanced three times more to put one chair on each side
#  of the table.  The completed shape is a dinette, suitable for inlining
#  in to further worlds.
#
#  Things to experiment with:
#        Add things to the table, such as plates, glasses, candles, etc.
#
#        Add a point light source at the tip of a candle on the table
#
#        Change the table to use a formica table top texture.  Change the
#        table and chair legs to chrome by using a specular color and
#        shininess factor in their Material nodes.  Add a cloth texture to
#        the chair seats.
#
#        Place the dinette in a room by inlining it.
