Welcome to the <i>Introduction to VRML 97</i> tutorial notes!
These tutorial notes have been written to give you a quick,
practical, example-driven overview of <i>VRML 97</i>, the Web's
Virtual Reality Modeling Language.
Included are over 500 pages of tutorial material with
nearly 200 images and over 100 VRML examples.
<p>
To use these tutorial notes you will need an HTML Web browser with
support for viewing VRML worlds.  An up to date list of available
VRML browsing and authoring software is available at:
<p>
<ul>
	<a href="http://vrml.sdsc.edu"><b>The VRML Repository</b></a>
	<br>

</ul>

<p>
<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>What's included in these notes</b></font></dt>

<p>
These tutorial notes primarily contain two types of information:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>General information, such as this preface
	<li>Tutorial slides and examples
</ol>
<p>
The tutorial slides are arranged as a sequence of 500+ hyper-linked
pages containing VRML syntax notes, VRML usage comments, or images of
sample VRML worlds.  Clicking on a sample world's
image loads the VRML world into your
browser for you to examine yourself.
<p>
Clicking on a sample world's file name, shown underneath the image,
loads into your browser a text page showing the VRML code itself.
Using these links, or text editor, you can view the VRML code and
see how a particular effect is created.
In most cases, the VRML files contain extensive comments providing
information about the techniques the file illustrates.
<p>
The tutorial notes provide a necessarily terse overview of VRML.
It is recommended that you
invest in one of the VRML books on the market to get a more thorough
coverage of the language.  The book we recommend is one we co-authored:

Several other good VRML books are on the market as well.

<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>A word about VRML versions</b></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>
VRML has evolved through several versions of the language, starting
way back in late 1994.
These tutorial notes cover <i>VRML 97</i>, the latest version of the language.
To provide context, the following table provides a quick
overview of these VRML versions and the names they have become known by.
<p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Version/Released</b><BR><HR></td>
<td><b>Comments</b><BR><HR></td>
</tr>

<tr><td valign=top><b>VRML 1.0</b><BR>
May 1995</td>
<td valign=top>
		Begun in late 1994, the first version of VRML was
		largely based upon
		the <i>Open Inventor</i> file format developed by
		Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI).  The VRML 1.0 specification
		was completed in May 1995 and included support for
		shape building, lighting, and texturing.
		<p>
		VRML 1.0 browser plug-ins became widely available
		by late 1995, though few ever supported the full
		range of features defined by the VRML 1.0 specification.
		<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><b>VRML 1.0c</b><BR>
January 1996</td>
<td valign=top>
		As vendors began producing VRML 1.0 browsers, a number
		of ambiguities in the VRML 1.0 specification surfaced.
		These problems were corrected in a new VRML 1.0c (clarified)
		specification released in January 1996.  No new features
		were added to the language in VRML 1.0c.
		<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><b>VRML 1.1</b><BR>
canceled</td>
<td valign=top>
		In late 1995, discussion began on extensions to the VRML 1.0
		specification.  These extensions were intended to address
		language features that made browser implementation difficult
		or inefficient.  The extended language was tentatively
		dubbed VRML 1.1.  These enhancements were later dropped
		in favor of forging ahead on VRML 2.0 instead.
		<p>
		No VRML 1.1 browsers exist.
		<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><b>Moving Worlds</b><BR>
January 1996</td>
<td valign=top>
		VRML 1.0 included features for building static, unchanging
		worlds suitable for architectural walk-throughs and some
		scientific visualization applications.  To extend the
		language to support animation and interaction, the VRML
		architecture group made a call for proposals for a language
		redesign.
		Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and others worked together to
		create the <i>Moving Worlds</i> proposal, submitted
		in January 1996.
		That proposal was later accepted and became the starting
		point for developing VRML 2.0.  The final VRML 2.0
		language specification is still sometimes referred to as
		the Moving Worlds specification, though it differs
		significantly
		from the original Moving Worlds proposal.
		<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><b>VRML 2.0</b><BR>
August 1996</td>
<td valign=top>
		After seven months of intense effort by the VRML
		community, the Moving Worlds proposal evolved to
		become the final VRML 2.0 specification, released
		in August 1996.  The new specification redesigned
		the VRML syntax and added an extensive set of new
		features for shape building, animation, interaction,
		sound, fog, backgrounds, and language extensions.
		<p>
		While multiple VRML 2.0 browsers exist today,
		as of this writing, none are <i>complete</i>.  All
		of the browsers are missing a few features.  Fortunately,
		most of the missing features are obscure aspects of VRML.
		<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><b>VRML 97</b><BR>
December 1997</td>
<td valign=top>
		In early 1997, efforts got under way to present
		the VRML 2.0 specification to the International
		Standards Organization (ISO) which oversees most of
		the major language specifications in use in the
		computing community.  The ISO version of VRML 2.0
		was reviewed and the specification significantly
		rewritten to clarify issues.  A few minor changes
		to the language were also made.  The final ISO VRML
		was dubbed <i>VRML 97</i>.  The VRML 97 specification
		features finalized in March 1997 and its explanitory
		text finalized in September 1997.  This specification
		was ratified by ISO in December 1997.
		<p>
		Most major VRML 2.0 browsers are now VRML 97 browsers.

<p>
VRML 1.0 and VRML 2.0 differ radically in syntax
and features.  A VRML 1.0 browser cannot display VRML 2.0 worlds.
Most VRML 2.0 browsers, however, can display VRML 1.0 worlds.
<p>
VRML 97 differs in a few minor ways from VRML 2.0.  In most cases,
a VRML 2.0 browser will be able to correctly display VRML 97 files.
However, for 100% accuracy, you should have a VRML 97 compliant
browser for viewing the VRML files contained within these tutorial notes.

<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>How these tutorial notes were created</b></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>
These tutorial notes were developed and tested on a PC with a Diamond
Multimedia FireGL 1000 3D accelerator card, and on a Silicon Graphics
High Impact UNIX workstation.
HTML and VRML text was hand-authored using a text editor.
In some cases Perl and C programs were used to automatically generate
smooth surfaces and animation paths.
<P>
A Perl script, called <TT><FONT COLOR=#00FF00>mktalk</FONT></TT>,
developed by John Moreland, was used to process raw tutorial notes
text and produce the 500+ individual HTML files, one per tutorial slide.
<p>
HTML text was displayed using Netscape Navigator 4.04 on Silicon Graphics
and PC systems and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 on PC systems.
Colors were checked for viewability in 24-bit, 16-bit, and
8-bit display modes on a PC.  Text sizes were chosen for viewability
at a normal 12 point font on-screen, and at an 24 point font for presentation
during the tutorial.  The large text, white-on-black colors,
and terse language are used to insure that slides are readable when
displayed for the tutorial audience.
<p>
VRML worlds were displayed on Silicon Graphics systems using the
Silicon Graphics Cosmo Player 1.02 VRML 97 compliant browser
for Netscape Navigator.
The same worlds were displayed on PC systems using
Silicon Graphics Cosmo Player 2.0 for Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<p>
Texture images were created using Adobe PhotoShop 4.0 on a PC with
help from KAI's PowerTools 3.0 from MetaTools.
Image processing was also performed using the Image Tools suite
of applications for UNIX workstations from the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
<p>
PDF tutorial notes for printing were created by dumping
individual tutorial slides to PostScript on a Silicon Graphics workstation.
The PostScript was transferred to a PC where it was converted to PDF
and assembled into a single PDF file using Adobe's Distiller and Exchange.
