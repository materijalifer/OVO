	VRML (the Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is an international
	standard for describing 3-D shapes and scenery on the
	World Wide Web.  VRML's technology has very broad applicability,
	including web-based entertainment, distributed visualization, 3-D
	user interfaces to remote web resources, 3-D collaborative
	environments, interactive simulations for education, virtual museums,
	virtual retail spaces, and more.  VRML is a key technology shaping
	the future of the web.
<p>
	Participants in this tutorial will learn how to use VRML 97
	(a.k.a. <i>ISO VRML</i>, <i>VRML 2.0</i>, and <i>Moving Worlds</i>)
	to author their
	own 3-D virtual worlds on the World Wide Web.  Participants will learn
	VRML concepts and terminology, and be introduced to VRML's text format
	syntax.  Participants also will learn tips and techniques for increasing
	performance and realism.  The tutorial includes numerous VRML examples
	and information on where to find out more about VRML features and use.
