These tutorial notes include a few VRML worlds that use
Java program scripts within <font color=#00FF00><tt>Script</tt></font> nodes.
The text for these program scripts is included in files with
<font color=#00FF00><tt>.java</tt></font>
file name extensions.
Before use, you will need to compile these Java program scripts to
Java byte-code contained in files with
<font color=#00FF00><tt>.class</tt></font>
file name extensions.

<p>
The VRML 97 specification does not require that a VRML browser
support the use of Java to create program scripts for
<font color=#00FF00><tt>Script</tt></font> nodes.
Fortunately, most VRML browsers do support Java program scripts,
though you should check your VRML browser's release notes to be sure
it is Java-enabled.
<p>
In principle, all Java-enabled VRML browsers 
identically support the VRML Java API as documented in the VRML 97
specification.  
Similarly, in principle, a compiled Java program script using
the VRML Java API can be
executed on any type of computer within any brand of VRML browser
<p>
In practice, neither of these ideal cases occurs.
The Java language is supported somewhat differently on different
platforms, particularly as the community transitions from
Java 1.0 to Java 1.1 and beyond.
Additionally, the VRML Java API is implemented somewhat differently
by different VRML browsers, making it difficult to insure that
a compiled Java class file will work for all VRML browsers
available now and in the future.
<p>
Because of Java incompatibilities observed with current VRML browsers,
these tutorial notes include source Java files, but <I>not</I>
compiled Java class files.
Before use, you will need
to compile the Java program scripts
yourself on your platform with your VRML browser
and your version of the Java language and support tools.

<p>
<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>Compiling Java</b></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>
To compile the Java examples, you will need:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>The VRML Java API class files for your VRML browser
	<li>A Java compiler
</ul>
<p>
All VRML browsers that support Java program scripts supply their
own set of VRML Java API class files.  Typically these are automatically
installed when you install your VRML browser.
<p>
There are multiple Java compilers available for most platforms.
Sun Microsystems provides the Java Development Kit (JDK) for free
from its Web site at
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com">http://www.javasoft.com</a>.
The JDK includes the <tt>javac</tt> compiler
and instructions on how to use it.  Multiple commercial Java
development environments are available from Microsoft, Silicon
Graphics, Symantec, and others.  An up to date list of available
Java products is available at Gamelan's Web site at
<a href="http://www.gamelan.com">http://www.gamelan.com</a>.
<p>
Once you have the VRML Java API class files and a Java compiler, you
will need to compile the supplied Java files.
Each platform
and Java compiler is different.  You'll have to consult your software's
manuals.
<p>
Once compiled, place the
<font color=#00FF00><tt>.class</tt></font>
files in the
<font color=#00FF00><tt>examples</tt></font>
folder along with the other tutorial examples.  Now, when you click on a
VRML world using a Java program script, the class files will be
automatically loaded and the example will run.

<p>
<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>What if my VRML browser doesn't support Java ?</b></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>
If your VRML browser doesn't support Java, then
those worlds that use Java will produce an error when
loaded into your VRML browser.
This is unfortunate since Java is an essential
feature that all VRML browsers should support.
Perhaps you should consider getting a different brand of VRML browser...
</dd>


<p>
<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>What if I don't compile the Java program scripts?</b></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>
If you have a VRML browser that doesn't support Java, or if
if you don't compile the Java program scripts, those worlds that
use Java will produce an error when loaded into your VRML browser.
Fortunately, Java
program scripts are only used in the <em>Writing program scripts
with Java</em> section of the tutorial slides.  So, if you don't
compile the Java program scripts, then just skip the VRML examples
in that section and everything will be fine.
