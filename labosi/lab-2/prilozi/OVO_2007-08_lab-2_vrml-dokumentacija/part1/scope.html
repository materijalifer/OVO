<P>ISO/IEC 14772, the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), defines
a file format that integrates 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually,
each VRML file is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural
objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms.
This part of ISO/IEC 14772 defines a primary set of objects and mechanisms
that encourage composition, encapsulation, and extension.</P>

<P>The semantics of VRML describe an abstract functional behaviour of time-based,
interactive 3D, multimedia information. ISO/IEC 14772 does not define physical
devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts (e.g., screen resolution
and input devices). ISO/IEC 14772 is intended for a wide variety of devices
and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation
of the functionality. For example, ISO/IEC 14772 does not assume the existence
of a mouse or 2D display device.</P>

<P>Each VRML file:</P>

<P><!--NOEDIT--><OL START="1" TYPE="a">
  <LI>implicitly establishes a world coordinate space for all objects defined
  in the file, as well as all objects included by the file;
  <LI>explicitly defines and composes a set of 3D and multimedia objects;
  <LI>can specify hyperlinks to other files and applications;
  <LI>can define object behaviours.
</OL><!--/NOEDIT--></P>

<P>An important characteristic of VRML files is the ability to compose files
together through inclusion and to relate files together through hyperlinking.
For example, consider the file <I>earth.wrl</I> which specifies a world
that contains a sphere representing the earth. This file may also contain
references to a variety of other VRML files representing cities on the earth
(e.g., file <I>paris.wrl)</I>. The enclosing file, <I>earth.wrl</I>, defines
the coordinate system that all the cities reside in. Each city file defines
the world coordinate system that the city resides in but that becomes a
local coordinate system when contained by the earth file.</P>

<P>Hierarchical file inclusion enables the creation of arbitrarily large,
dynamic worlds. Therefore, VRML ensures that each file is completely described
by the objects contained within it.</P>

<P>Another essential characteristic of VRML is that it is intended to be
used in a distributed environment such as the World Wide Web. There are
various objects and mechanisms built into the language that support multiple
distributed files, including:</P>

<P><!--NOEDIT--><OL START="5" TYPE="a">
  <LI>in-lining of other VRML files;
  <LI>hyperlinking to other files;
  <LI>using established Internet and ISO standards for other file formats;
  <LI>defining a compact syntax.
</OL><!--/NOEDIT--></P>

<p>
VRML geospatial capabilities provide precise association between
objects within a VRML world and physical locations on the Earth.
