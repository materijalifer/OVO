ISO/IEC 14772-1, the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), defines
a file format that integrates 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually,
each VRML file is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural
objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms.
This part of ISO/IEC 14772 defines the interface that applications external
to the VRML browser may use to access and manipulate the objects defined
in <a HREF="../index.html">ISO/IEC 14772-1</a>.

<P>The interface described here is designed to allow an external environment
to access nodes in a VRML scene using the existing <a HREF="../part1/concepts.html#4.10">VRML
event model</a>. In this model, an eventOut of a given node can be routed
to an eventIn of another node. When the eventOut generates an event, the
eventIn is notified and its node processes that event. Additionally, if
a script in a <B>Script</B> node has a reference to a given node it can
send events directly to any eventIn of that node and it can read the last
value sent from any of its eventOuts.

<P>The scope of this specification is to cover all forms of access to a
VRML browser from external applications. It is equally valid for a database
with a object interface to access a standalone browser in a presentation
slide as it is for a Java applet operating within a web browser and the
available services do not vary.

<P>This specification does not provide a byte level protocol description
as there can be many valid ways of expressing an interaction with a browser.
Instead, it represents the interface in terms of the services provided
and the parameters that are passed to access these services. Individual
language and protocol bindings to these services are available as annexes
to this part of ISO/IEC 14772.
